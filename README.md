# DATA SCIENCE JOB MARKET ANALYSIS

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyse over 500 job listings for Data Science Analytic roles across multiple U.S companies. The objective was to uncover the factors influencing salary levels, employer ratings and job opportunities across industries, company sizes and locations.

### DATA SOURCE

 Job HR Data: The primary dataset for this analysis is the "Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv" file containing detailed information about jobs compiled for over 500+ job listings.

### DATA CLEANING / PREPARATION

In the intial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the Job HR Data to answer key questions such as 
- What factors influence salary estimates and company ratings. 
- Which industries and locations offer the best opportunities.
- How company attributes like size, founding year, and ownership affect job prospects.

### DATA ANALYSIS

Include some interesting codes / features worked with;

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### RESULTS AND FINDINGS

The analysis results are summarised as follows:
- Average Salaries range between $85K-$130K,wIth senior roles such as Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineering  leading pay scales.

- Medium to large companies (500-5000+ employees) maintain the highest average employer ratings (4.1/5).

- The Technology & Financial Services Industries show both above -average salaries and ratings.

- Major hubs ,San Francisco, New York, and Seattle  dominates job availability and salary potential.

- Established companies(15+years) pays roughly 18-22% more than start-ups companies.


### RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Recruitment for high value roles should be between senior data scientis $ ML engineers.
- Focus on top cities like San Franciso, New York City, Washington.
- Keep salaries competitive in Health and Finance sectors.
- Highlight growth potential to attract talent to start-ups.
- Implement a skill-based hiring strategy (to align required skills with salary levels).
- Develop a data driven compensation dashboard to continuously monitor pay equity and market trends.


### LIMITATIONS

- Data coverage: The dataset only includes about 500+ job listings, which may not represent the entire global data science job market.
- Data accuracy: Salary estimates and company ratings are sourced from job postings (Glassdoor-like), which may be self reported or outdated.
- Incomplete information: Some listings contain missing fields such as company revenue and founding yea, which could affect analysis accuracy.
- Geographically bias: The data mainly reflects U. S. locations, limiting the generalizability to other religions.
- Analytical scope: The project focuses on descriptive analysis (SQL + Excel) and does not include predictive modeling or advanced statistical testing.
